# Analysis-and-design
•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
During this course, I was tasked with solving problems that stem from poor development. Throughout this term, we were tasked with memory usage, and analyzing run-time. Learning about arrays, linked lists, trees, ques, and stacks. These helped to work on projects one and two where we had to create a list that prints computer science courses in an alphanumeric list. 
•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
In the approach to these problems, I had to understand what requirements are requested and how to build an appropriate data structure. By the use of algorithms and memory usage to optimize my code. This allowed me to manipulate my data much more effectively. 
•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The biggest roadblock I faced during this course was definitely the code in Project 3. Taking care of mistakes in previous algorithms in Project 2 helps to break down and find the proper code to work. I need to take more time and test small sections of code before continuing into the final solution. 
•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has definitely helped in my optimization of these projects and how to properly approach them. My biggest enjoyment is seeing the finished product, with building pseudocode to the different data structures. 
•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This work was hugely helpful in the way I write clear code. It’s helping me improve my approach and programming skills to be stronger than before. This has shown me the errors and how to handle them. Still need to work on my inline comments. But overall was an excellent term that will help in building high-quality software in the future.
